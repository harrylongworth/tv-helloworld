<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>This is an example of a basic Teacher Virus (TV) payload.  You can install it in Teacher Virus via the admin area with the following options:</p>
<p><b>Payload Source:</b> GitHub</p>
<p><b>GitHub Username:</b> harrylongworth</p>
<p><b>GitHub Repository:</b> tv-helloworld</p>
<p>You can give it a <b>Payload Name</b> if you like - this will allow you to install a payload more than once if you choose a different name each time you install it.</p>
<p>Install it as a <b>Payload Type</b> of Play if you want it to show up in the play area (the default page you see when you click the "Just play" button of a Teacher Virus website/device) - or select admin if you want it in the admin console (the area you access from the Cog icon). Ignore the other options for the moment.</p>
<p>You can see what makes this payload work at its GitHub repository:  <a href="https://github.com/harrylongworth/tv-helloworld">github.com/harrylongworth/tv-helloworld</a></p>
<p>To create your own first payload why don't you fork this payload and give it a go? You'll then be able to install your forked version by simply entering in your GitHub username and the name you give the forked repository. For example we forked this payload under the OATSEA account which means you could also install it with the username: OATSEA and repo: tv-helloworld - note the case of the word OATSEA - <b>these settings are case sensative!</b></p>
<p>The beauty of the system is that you can then simply use the GitHub editing ability to modify your html file contents - save it (commit the changes) and then reinstall your payload and it'll have the new version straight away!  You can also turn on a developer option (in TV Admin settings) that allows you to select a branch other than master so that you can work on a dev version without breaking your payloads use by others!</p>
<p>We use the <b>"tv-"</b> prefix in the name of our GitHub repositories by convention. <b>tvp</b> is for a player/engine payload type, <b>tva</b> for admin payloads, <b>tvc</b> for content and <b>tvs</b> for apis (or web services).  But you don't have to follow that convention if you don't want to.</p>
<p>If you want to build a payload from scratch - all it takes to create a working payload (our word for apps that run on the TV platform) is at least an index.html (or index.php) file in the root of a GitHub repository.</p>
<p>You should also include an icon.png (or icon.svg) file to become the button image for your payload - [make it a square image!].  If you don't provide an image, TV will use the default OATSEA logo image (which this payload uses)</p>
<p>GitHub will suggest (and we agree) that you also create a README.md file to explain your payload - and an open source license file (Apache 2.0 please).</p>
<p>Now if you don't want to use GitHub you can zip up a folder holding your files and use the file upload or install from url options instead (or simply upload your files to the appropriate folder of your webserver in a subfolder)</p>
<p>Once you've got all that sorted and have created something cool - why don't you <a href="http://teachervirus.org/contribute/register-payload.html">register your payload</a> and share it with the rest of the world in the Teacher Virus Catalog at teachervirus.org?</p>
